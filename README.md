# ItemInfoDisplay

This mod is only found at https://thunderstore.io/c/peak/p/jkqt/ItemInfoDisplay/ - Do NOT download it from anywhere else!

Displays item information to the left of item prompts (at the bottom right of your screen).
It works by inefficiently scanning all components of the equipped item to pull information from.

Displays:
- Status Changes (e.g. Hunger, Poison)
- Weight
- Remaining Item Uses
- Cookability
- Number of Times Cooked
- Some Effects & Afflictions

This mod is mainly for getting the numbers on consumable items.
It has limited quantification of equipment effects such as ropes (and remedy fungus).

Configurable:
- Font Size
- Text Outline Width
- Size Delta X (suboptimal workaround to move the text horizontally)
- Force Update Time
