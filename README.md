# ItemInfoDisplay

Displays item information to the left of item prompts (which is most likely bottom right of your screen).
It just inefficiently scans all the components of an item to pull information from.

Displays:
- Status Changes (e.g. Hunger, Poison)
- Weight
- Remaining Item Uses
- Cookability
- # Times Cooked
- Some Effects & Afflictions

This mod is mainly for getting the numbers on consumable items.
It has limited quantification of equipment effects such as ropes.

Configurable:
- Font Size
- Text Outline Width
- Size Delta X (suboptimal workaround to move the text horizontally)
- Force Update Time

Overall, the mod's pretty jank, but it kinda works (for now).
It'll probably break after some update since devs are still actively working on things.
